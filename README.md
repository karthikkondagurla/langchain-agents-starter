Title: LangChain Agents Starter

A hands-on starter project demonstrating how to build, configure, and run LangChain Agents in Python. This notebook shows how to wire up tools (e.g., a calculator), connect to an LLM (e.g., Google Gemini), and orchestrate tool-using agents for practical tasks.

- Quick to run in Google Colab
- Minimal, readable code
- Extensible with your own tools and models

Features
- Agent setup with LangChain
- Tool integration (Calculator example)
- Prompting and agent reasoning loop
- Configurable LLM (e.g., Gemini)
- Example tasks and usage patterns

Project Structure
- LangChain_Agents_Starter.ipynb — the main Colab notebook with step-by-step cells
- README.md — project overview and instructions

Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (handled automatically in Colab)
- Google Colab account
- API access for your chosen LLM (e.g., Google Gemini API key)
- GitHub account if you want to version control the notebook

Getting Started
1) Open in Colab
- Upload or open LangChain_Agents_Starter.ipynb in Google Colab.

2) Install dependencies
- Run the “Setup/Install” cell in the notebook to install required packages (e.g., langchain, langchain-community, google-generativeai, etc.).

3) Configure environment
- Provide your model credentials (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY) in the notebook as environment variables or Colab secrets.

4) Run the examples
- Execute the cells to:
  - Initialize the LLM
  - Register tools (Calculator)
  - Create and run an Agent
  - Observe the agent’s tool calls and final answers

Example Usage
- Ask the Agent a question that requires calculation:
  - “What is 23% of 456, then add 78?”
- Ask the Agent to reason step-by-step and call tools when needed.
- Extend the toolset (see Extending Tools) and re-run the agent.

Configuration
- Model: swap the LLM provider or model name in the configuration cell
- Temperature/top_p: adjust for more/less creative outputs
- Tool timeouts: tune per tool for reliability
- Logging/verbosity: enable agent tracing or verbose output for debugging

Extending Tools
Add your own tools by implementing simple Python callables and wrapping them with LangChain tool helpers.

```python
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool("search_docs", return_direct=False)
def search_docs(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Search internal docs for relevant snippets.
    """
    # TODO: implement your search logic
    return "Mocked search result for: " + query
```

- Register the tool with the agent’s toolset
- Give it a clear docstring; the agent relies on this to decide when to use it
- Ensure idempotent, fast, and well-logged behavior

Common Pitfalls
- Missing API keys: verify environment variables are set
- Package versions: if you see import errors, re-run the install cell or pin versions
- Tool conflicts: ensure unique tool names and concise docstrings
- Long outputs: adjust verbosity if the agent prints excessive traces

Roadmap
- Add web search/retrieval tool
- Add structured output parsing
- Add memory for multi-turn workflows
- Add tests for tool functions

Troubleshooting
- Colab runtime reset: re-run install and setup cells
- Rate limits: add retry/backoff, lower concurrency
- Unexpected tool usage: refine tool descriptions and prompts
